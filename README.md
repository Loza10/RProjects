# RProjects
A collection of R projects from Zakk Loveall over the course of a Data Wrangling class I took. These projects mostly focused on cleaning data and getting it into a readable format.

For a quick note, the projects outside the HW and finalProject folders are mostly testing scripts. Simply just scripts where I was learning how certain tools/functions worked.
